<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Myself Prakash Kumar, currently I am pursuing Btech in Electrical Engineering at 
  Motilal Nehru National Institute Of Technology Allahabad, Prayagraj. I am very much passionated in engineering studies, 
  which has dragged me to this institute. Talking about my projects which I have successfully completed here are 
  related to Robotics like: Remote Control Bot, A Bot equipped with esp camera module which enables the controller to 
  navigate it without actually looking at it, also my third project was "Detect and Direct" event, this project included machine learning,
  tensorflow, 3D image creation and many more techstacks. For the 3rd project our group were awarded with 2nd prize at the 
  institute.

<p>Talking about my interest and hobbies: so as I already mentioned that I am passionated in engineering studies but to be 
  precise it's Machine Learning and web Development. What I want to do is to build a model or project using these two fields
  to tackle the daily life problem. Like with the help of Opencv and dlib I made a digital attendance model which works on face detection
  but it has certain issues on which I am working sideways.
</p>

<p>Lastly, I would like to mention that as a citizen of India I am trying to make myself capable of serving the nation with 
  such technologies. <b>Thank You.</b>
